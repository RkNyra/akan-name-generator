By Rhoda Kimanga (RK Nyra)

## Description
This is my first web application <a href = "https://rknyra.github.io/akan-name-generator/">Akan Name Generator</a>. I developed it as my one of my first web pages during the beginner stages of my programming class in Moringa School-Nairobi. You can view it <a href = "https://rknyra.github.io/akan-name-generator/">here</a>.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
Text editer - I used Visual Studio
Github account
Git installed in pc
Terminal or command line

## Behavior Driven Development
1. The user is expected to find out their Akan Name based on their birthday and gender
2. The user inputs their gender and their birthday in the form
3. On clicking submit, the web app calculates:
  i) The day of the week the user was born based on their birthday
  ii) The user's possible Akan Name based on their gender and the day of the week they were born
4. The app then reveals to the user their result which includes:
  i) The day of the week they were born,
  ii) The akan name
